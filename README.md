# Deal-With-It
For the final project in my AP Computer Science course, my partner Sophia and I developed Deal With It in Java, using imported swing and awt libraries. It teaches users about the effects of peer pressure through an interactive story video game. The user navigates the game using keyboard and mouse I/O.

Rather than having a large game class, Object-Oriented Programming techniques were used to create multiple classes that worked together.
